An Extended Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (E-ART) for Dual Spectral CT,

# Compared with standard computed tomography (CT), dual spectral CT (DSCT) has many advantages for object separation, contrast enhancement, artifact reduction, and material composition assessment. But it is generally difficult to reconstruct images from polychromatic projections acquired by DSCT, because of the nonlinear relation between the polychromatic projections and the images to be reconstructed. This paper first models the DSCT reconstruction problem as a nonlinear system problem; and then extend the classic ART method to solve the nonlinear system. One feature of the proposed method is its flexibility. It fits for any scanning configurations commonly used and does not require consistent rays for different X-ray spectra. Another feature of the proposed method is its high degree of parallelism, which means that the method is suitable for acceleration on GPUs (graphic processing units) or other parallel systems. The method is validated with numerical experiments from simulated noise free and noisy data. High quality images are reconstructed with the proposed method from the polychromatic projections of DSCT. The reconstructed images are still satisfactory even if there are certain errors in the estimated X-ray spectra.
