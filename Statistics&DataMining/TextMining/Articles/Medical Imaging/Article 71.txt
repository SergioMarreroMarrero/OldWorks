Theoretical Comparison of a Dual Energy System and Photon Counting Silicon Detector Used for Material Quantification in Spectral CT,

# Any method using dual energy computed tomography (CT) has to make prior assumptions in order to quantify k-edge contrast agents. This work estimates the mean square error (MSE) in contrast agent quantification employing a method based on assigning each reconstructed voxel a ratio of soft tissue and fat using dual energy CT. The results are compared to the MSE using a photon counting silicon detector with multiple bins. The square root of the MSEs of the quantifications of iodine and gadolinium for an object consisting of soft tissue and fat using the silicon detector and dual energy CT range from below 2% and 1% of the contrast agent content for 100 mg/cm3 of iodine and gadolinium, up to approximately 10% and 13%, and 6% and 4%, for 5 mg/cm3 of iodine and gadolinium, respectively. When adding bone with a voxel volume fraction of 2.2%, the square root of the MSEs of the quantifications of iodine and gadolinium using dual energy CT increases to 25% and 6%, respectively, for 5 mg/cm3 of contrast agent. In conclusion, results indicate that the noise levels of the material quantification using the silicon detector are higher than the noise levels using a dual energy CT when the composition of the object is known. However, using a dual energy CT increases the risk of model specification error and subsequently a large bias in contrast agent quantification, a problem which does not exist when using a multi-bin CT where the number of energy bins is larger than two.
