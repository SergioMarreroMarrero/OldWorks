Stratified Sampling Voxel Classification for Segmentation of Intraretinal and Subretinal Fluid in Longitudinal Clinical OCT Data,

# Automated three-dimensional retinal fluid (named symptomatic exudate-associated derangements, SEAD) segmentation in 3D OCT volumes is of high interest in the improved management of neovascular Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). SEAD segmentation plays an important role in the treatment of neovascular AMD, but accurate segmentation is challenging because of the large diversity of SEAD size, location, and shape. Here a novel voxel classification based approach using a layer-dependent stratified sampling strategy was developed to address the class imbalance problem in SEAD detection. The method was validated on a set of 30 longitudinal 3D OCT scans from 10 patients who underwent anti-VEGF treatment. Two retinal specialists manually delineated all intraretinal and subretinal fluid. Leave-one-patient-out evaluation resulted in a true positive rate and true negative rate of 96% and 0.16% respectively. This method showed promise for image guided therapy of neovascular AMD treatment.
