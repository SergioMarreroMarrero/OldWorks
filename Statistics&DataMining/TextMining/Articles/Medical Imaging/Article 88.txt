Single-Cell Tracking With PET Using a Novel Trajectory Reconstruction Algorithm,

# Virtually all biomedical applications of positron emission tomography (PET) use images to represent the distribution of a radiotracer. However, PET is increasingly used in cell tracking applications, for which the “imaging” paradigm may not be optimal. Here, we investigate an alternative approach, which consists in reconstructing the time-varying position of individual radiolabeled cells directly from PET measurements. As a proof of concept, we formulate a new algorithm for reconstructing the trajectory of one single moving cell directly from list-mode PET data. We model the trajectory as a 3-D B-spline function of the temporal variable and use nonlinear optimization to minimize the mean-square distance between the trajectory and the recorded list-mode coincidence events. Using Monte Carlo simulations (GATE), we show that this new algorithm can track a single source moving within a small-animal PET system with 3 mm accuracy provided that the activity of the cell [Bq] is greater than four times its velocity [mm/s]. The algorithm outperforms conventional ML-EM as well as the “minimum distance” method used for positron emission particle tracking (PEPT). The new method was also successfully validated using experimentally acquired PET data. In conclusion, we demonstrated the feasibility of a new method for tracking a single moving cell directly from PET list-mode data, at the whole-body level, for physiologically relevant activities and velocities.
