Higher-Order Motion-Compensation for In Vivo Cardiac Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Rats,

# Motion of the heart has complicated in vivo applications of cardiac diffusion MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), especially in small animals such as rats where ultra-high-performance gradient sets are currently not available. Even with velocity compensation via, for example, bipolar encoding pulses, the variable shot-to-shot residual motion-induced spin phase can still give rise to pronounced artifacts. This study presents diffusion-encoding schemes that are designed to compensate for higher-order motion components, including acceleration and jerk, which also have the desirable practical features of minimal TEs and high achievable b-values. The effectiveness of these schemes was verified numerically on a realistic beating heart phantom, and demonstrated empirically with in vivo cardiac diffusion MRI in rats. Compensation for acceleration, and lower motion components, was found to be both necessary and sufficient for obtaining diffusion-weighted images of acceptable quality and SNR, which yielded the first in vivo cardiac DTI demonstrated in the rat. These findings suggest that compensation for higher order motion, particularly acceleration, can be an effective alternative solution to high-performance gradient hardware for improving in vivo cardiac DTI.
