Generalized Assorted Camera Arrays: Robust Cross-Channel Registration and Applications,

# One popular technique for multimodal imaging is generalized assorted pixels (GAP), where an assorted pixel array on the image sensor allows for multimodal capture. Unfortunately, GAP is limited in its applicability because of the need for multimodal filters that are amenable with semiconductor fabrication processes and results in a fixed multimodal imaging configuration. In this paper, we advocate for generalized assorted camera (GAC) arrays for multimodal imaging-i.e., a camera array with filters of different characteristics placed in front of each camera aperture. The GAC provides us with three distinct advantages over GAP: ease of implementation, flexible application-dependent imaging since filters are external and can be changed and depth information that can be used for enabling novel applications (e.g., postcapture refocusing). The primary challenge in GAC arrays is that since the different modalities are obtained from different viewpoints, there is a need for accurate and efficient cross-channel registration. Traditional approaches such as sum-of-squared differences, sum-of-absolute differences, and mutual information all result in multimodal registration errors. Here, we propose a robust cross-channel matching cost function, based on aligning normalized gradients, which allows us to compute cross-channel subpixel correspondences for scenes exhibiting nontrivial geometry. We highlight the promise of GAC arrays with our cross-channel normalized gradient cost for several applications such as low-light imaging, postcapture refocusing, skin perfusion imaging using color + near infrared, and hyperspectral imaging.
