Spartans: Single-Sample Periocular-Based Alignment-Robust Recognition Technique Applied to Non-Frontal Scenarios,

# In this paper, we investigate a single-sample periocular-based alignment-robust face recognition technique that is pose-tolerant under unconstrained face matching scenarios. Our Spartans framework starts by utilizing one single sample per subject class, and generate new face images under a wide range of 3D rotations using the 3D generic elastic model which is both accurate and computationally economic. Then, we focus on the periocular region where the most stable and discriminant features on human faces are retained, and marginalize out the regions beyond the periocular region since they are more susceptible to expression variations and occlusions. A novel facial descriptor, high-dimensional Walsh local binary patterns, is uniformly sampled on facial images with robustness toward alignment. During the learning stage, subject-dependent advanced correlation filters are learned for pose-tolerant non-linear subspace modeling in kernel feature space followed by a coupled max-pooling mechanism which further improve the performance. Given any unconstrained unseen face image, the Spartans can produce a highly discriminative matching score, thus achieving high verification rate. We have evaluated our method on the challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild database and solidly outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms under four evaluation protocols with a high accuracy of 89.69%, a top score among image-restricted and unsupervised protocols. The advancement of Spartans is also proven in the Face Recognition Grand Challenge and Multi-PIE databases. In addition, our learning method based on advanced correlation filters is much more effective, in terms of learning subject-dependent pose-tolerant subspaces, compared with many well-established subspace methods in both linear and non-linear cases.
