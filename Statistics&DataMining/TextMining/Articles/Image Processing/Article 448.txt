Local Wavelet Pattern: A New Feature Descriptor for Image Retrieval in Medical CT Databases,

# A new image feature description based on the local wavelet pattern (LWP) is proposed in this paper to characterize the medical computer tomography (CT) images for content-based CT image retrieval. In the proposed work, the LWP is derived for each pixel of the CT image by utilizing the relationship of center pixel with the local neighboring information. In contrast to the local binary pattern that only considers the relationship between a center pixel and its neighboring pixels, the presented approach first utilizes the relationship among the neighboring pixels using local wavelet decomposition, and finally considers its relationship with the center pixel. A center pixel transformation scheme is introduced to match the range of center value with the range of local wavelet decomposed values. Moreover, the introduced local wavelet decomposition scheme is centrally symmetric and suitable for CT images. The novelty of this paper lies in the following two ways: 1) encoding local neighboring information with local wavelet decomposition and 2) computing LWP using local wavelet decomposed values and transformed center pixel values. We tested the performance of our method over three CT image databases in terms of the precision and recall. We also compared the proposed LWP descriptor with the other state-of-the-art local image descriptors, and the experimental results suggest that the proposed method outperforms other methods for CT image retrieval.
