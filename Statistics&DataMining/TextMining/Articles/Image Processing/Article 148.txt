Recursive Approximation of the Bilateral Filter,

# This paper presents a complete proof that the bilateral filter can be implemented recursively, as long as: 1) the spatial filter can be implemented recursively and 2) the range filter can be decomposed into a recursive product. As a result, an O(ND) solution can be obtained for bilateral filtering, where N is the image size and D is the dimensionality.
