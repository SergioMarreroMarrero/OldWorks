Background Subtraction Based on Low-Rank and Structured Sparse Decomposition,

# Low rank and sparse representation based methods, which make few specific assumptions about the background, have recently attracted wide attention in background modeling. With these methods, moving objects in the scene are modeled as pixel-wised sparse outliers. However, in many practical scenarios, the distributions of these moving parts are not truly pixel-wised sparse but structurally sparse. Meanwhile a robust analysis mechanism is required to handle background regions or foreground movements with varying scales. Based on these two observations, we first introduce a class of structured sparsity-inducing norms to model moving objects in videos. In our approach, we regard the observed sequence as being constituted of two terms, a low-rank matrix (background) and a structured sparse outlier matrix (foreground). Next, in virtue of adaptive parameters for dynamic videos, we propose a saliency measurement to dynamically estimate the support of the foreground. Experiments on challenging well known data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and works effectively on a wide range of complex videos.
