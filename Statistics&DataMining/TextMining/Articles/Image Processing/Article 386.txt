Robust, Error-Tolerant Photometric Projector Compensation,

# We propose a novel error tolerant optimization approach to generate a high-quality photometric compensated projection. The application of a non-linear color mapping function does not require radiometric pre-calibration of cameras or projectors. This characteristic improves the compensation quality compared with related linear methods if this approach is used with devices that apply complex color processing, such as single-chip digital light processing projectors. Our approach consists of a sparse sampling of the projector's color gamut and non-linear scattered data interpolation to generate the per-pixel mapping from the projector to camera colors in real time. To avoid out-of-gamut artifacts, the input image's luminance is automatically adjusted locally in an optional offline optimization step that maximizes the achievable contrast while preserving smooth input gradients without significant clipping errors. To minimize the appearance of color artifacts at high-frequency reflectance changes of the surface due to usually unavoidable slight projector vibrations and movement (drift), we show that a drift measurement and analysis step, when combined with per-pixel compensation image optimization, significantly decreases the visibility of such artifacts.
