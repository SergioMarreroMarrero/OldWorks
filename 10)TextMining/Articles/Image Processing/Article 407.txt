Variational Depth From Focus Reconstruction,

# This paper deals with the problem of reconstructing a depth map from a sequence of differently focused images, also known as depth from focus (DFF) or shape from focus. We propose to state the DFF problem as a variational problem, including a smooth but nonconvex data fidelity term and a convex nonsmooth regularization, which makes the method robust to noise and leads to more realistic depth maps. In addition, we propose to solve the nonconvex minimization problem with a linearized alternating directions method of multipliers, allowing to minimize the energy very efficiently. A numerical comparison to classical methods on simulated as well as on real data is presented.
