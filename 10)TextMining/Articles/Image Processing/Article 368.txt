Subjective and Objective Video Quality Assessment of 3D Synthesized Views With Texture/Depth Compression Distortion,

# The quality assessment for synthesized video with texture/depth compression distortion is important for the design, optimization, and evaluation of the multi-view video plus depth (MVD)-based 3D video system. In this paper, the subjective and objective studies for synthesized view assessment are both conducted. First, a synthesized video quality database with texture/depth compression distortion is presented with subjective scores given by 56 subjects. The 140 videos are synthesized from ten MVD sequences with different texture/depth quantization combinations. Second, a full reference objective video quality assessment (VQA) method is proposed concerning about the annoying temporal flicker distortion and the change of spatio-temporal activity in the synthesized video. The proposed VQA algorithm has a good performance evaluated on the entire synthesized video quality database, and is particularly prominent on the subsets which have significant temporal flicker distortion induced by depth compression and view synthesis process.
