Robust Ellipse Fitting via Half-Quadratic and Semidefinite Relaxation Optimization,

# Ellipse fitting is widely applied in the fields of computer vision and automatic manufacture. However, the introduced edge point errors (especially outliers) from image edge detection will cause severe performance degradation of the subsequent ellipse fitting procedure. To alleviate the influence of outliers, we develop a robust ellipse fitting method in this paper. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, to be robust against the outliers, we introduce the maximum correntropy criterion into the constrained least-square (CLS) ellipse fitting method, and apply the half-quadratic optimization algorithm to solve the nonlinear and nonconvex problem in an alternate manner. Second, to ensure that the obtained solution is related to an ellipse, we introduce a special quadratic equality constraint into the aforementioned CLS model, which results in the nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem. Finally, we derive the semidefinite relaxation version of the aforementioned problem in terms of the trace operator and thus determine the ellipse parameters using semidefinite programming. Some simulated and experimental examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed ellipse fitting approach.
