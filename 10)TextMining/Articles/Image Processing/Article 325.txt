Heterogeneous Graph Propagation for Large-Scale Web Image Search,

# State-of-the-art web image search frameworks are often based on the bag-of-visual-words (BoVWs) model and the inverted index structure. Despite the simplicity, efficiency, and scalability, they often suffer from low precision and/or recall, due to the limited stability of local features and the considerable information loss on the quantization stage. To refine the quality of retrieved images, various postprocessing methods have been adopted after the initial search process. In this paper, we investigate the online querying process from a graph-based perspective. We introduce a heterogeneous graph model containing both image and feature nodes explicitly, and propose an efficient reranking approach consisting of two successive modules, i.e., incremental query expansion and image-feature voting, to improve the recall and precision, respectively. Compared with the conventional reranking algorithms, our method does not require using geometric information of visual words, therefore enjoys low consumptions of both time and memory. Moreover, our method is independent of the initial search process, and could cooperate with many BoVW-based image search pipelines, or adopted after other postprocessing algorithms. We evaluate our approach on large-scale image search tasks and verify its competitive search performance.
