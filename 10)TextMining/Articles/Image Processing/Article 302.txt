Incorporating Adaptive Local Information Into Fuzzy Clustering for Image Segmentation,

# Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering with spatial constraints has attracted great attention in the field of image segmentation. However, most of the popular techniques fail to resolve misclassification problems due to the inaccuracy of their spatial models. This paper presents a new unsupervised FCM-based image segmentation method by paying closer attention to the selection of local information. In this method, region-level local information is incorporated into the fuzzy clustering procedure to adaptively control the range and strength of interactive pixels. First, a novel dissimilarity function is established by combining region-based and pixel-based distance functions together, in order to enhance the relationship between pixels which have similar local characteristics. Second, a novel prior probability function is developed by integrating the differences between neighboring regions into the mean template of the fuzzy membership function, which adaptively selects local spatial constraints by a tradeoff weight depending upon whether a pixel belongs to a homogeneous region or not. Through incorporating region-based information into the spatial constraints, the proposed method strengthens the interactions between pixels within the same region and prevents over smoothing across region boundaries. Experimental results over synthetic noise images, natural color images, and synthetic aperture radar images show that the proposed method achieves more accurate segmentation results, compared with five state-of-the-art image segmentation methods.
