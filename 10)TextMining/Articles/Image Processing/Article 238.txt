Multiscale Image Blind Denoising,

# Arguably several thousands papers are dedicated to image denoising. Most papers assume a fixed noise model, mainly white Gaussian or Poissonian. This assumption is only valid for raw images. Yet, in most images handled by the public and even by scientists, the noise model is imperfectly known or unknown. End users only dispose the result of a complex image processing chain effectuated by uncontrolled hardware and software (and sometimes by chemical means). For such images, recent progress in noise estimation permits to estimate from a single image a noise model, which is simultaneously signal and frequency dependent. We propose here a multiscale denoising algorithm adapted to this broad noise model. This leads to a blind denoising algorithm which we demonstrate on real JPEG images and on scans of old photographs for which the formation model is unknown. The consistency of this algorithm is also verified on simulated distorted images. This algorithm is finally compared with the unique state of the art previous blind denoising method.
