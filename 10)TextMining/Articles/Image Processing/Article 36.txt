Structure-Guided Statistical Textural Distinctiveness for Salient Region Detection in Natural Images,

# We propose a simple yet effective structure-guided statistical textural distinctiveness approach to salient region detection. Our method uses a multilayer approach to analyze the structural and textural characteristics of natural images as important features for salient region detection from a scale point of view. To represent the structural characteristics, we abstract the image using structured image elements and extract rotational-invariant neighborhood-based textural representations to characterize each element by an individual texture pattern. We then learn a set of representative texture atoms for sparse texture modeling and construct a statistical textural distinctiveness matrix to determine the distinctiveness between all representative texture atom pairs in each layer. Finally, we determine saliency maps for each layer based on the occurrence probability of the texture atoms and their respective statistical textural distinctiveness and fuse them to compute a final saliency map. Experimental results using four public data sets and a variety of performance evaluation metrics show that our approach provides promising results when compared with existing salient region detection approaches.
