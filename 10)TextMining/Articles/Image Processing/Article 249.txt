Salient Region Detection via Integrating Diffusion-Based Compactness and Local Contrast,

# Salient region detection is a challenging problem and an important topic in computer vision. It has a wide range of applications, such as object recognition and segmentation. Many approaches have been proposed to detect salient regions using different visual cues, such as compactness, uniqueness, and objectness. However, each visual cue-based method has its own limitations. After analyzing the advantages and limitations of different visual cues, we found that compactness and local contrast are complementary to each other. In addition, local contrast can very effectively recover incorrectly suppressed salient regions using compactness cues. Motivated by this, we propose a bottom-up salient region detection method that integrates compactness and local contrast cues. Furthermore, to produce a pixel-accurate saliency map that more uniformly covers the salient objects, we propagate the saliency information using a diffusion process. Our experimental results on four benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method produces more accurate saliency maps with better precision-recall curve and higher F-Measure than other 19 state-of-the-arts approaches on ASD, CSSD, and ECSSD data sets.
