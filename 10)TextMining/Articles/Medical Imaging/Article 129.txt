Low-Dimensional Non-Rigid Image Registration Using Statistical Deformation Models From Semi-Supervised Training Data,

# Accurate and robust image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis applications, and requires non-rigid transformations with a large number of degrees of freedom. Statistical deformation models (SDMs) attempt to learn the distribution of non-rigid deformations, and can be used both to reduce the transformation dimensionality and to constrain the registration process. However, high-dimensional SDMs are difficult to train given orders of magnitude fewer training samples. In this paper, we utilize both a small set of annotated imaging data and a large set of unlabeled data to effectively learn an SDM of non-rigid transformations in a semi-supervised training (SST) framework. We demonstrate results applying this framework towards inter-subject registration of skull-stripped, magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. Our approach makes use of 39 labeled MR datasets to create a set of supervised registrations, which we augment with a set of over 1200 unsupervised registrations using unlabeled MRIs. Through leave-one-out cross validation, we show that SST of a non-rigid SDM results in a robust registration algorithm with significantly improved accuracy compared to standard, intensity-based registration, and does so with a 99% reduction in transformation dimensionality.
