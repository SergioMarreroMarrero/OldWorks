A Single Scatter Model for X-ray CT Energy Spectrum Estimation and Polychromatic Reconstruction,

# To improve the quantitative accuracy of linear attenuation coefficients measured by computed tomography (CT), we used a single scatter model to estimate the Compton scatter distribution and then a polychromatic image reconstruction algorithm, namely the iterative maximum-likelihood polychromatic algorithm for CT (IMPACT), was implemented to include scatter correction (SC). To perform the IMPACT, the X-ray spectra of a tube were estimated via an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with SC. To test the accuracy of the estimated spectra, the projection images of cubic phantoms containing different depths of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) were acquired. The percentage of root mean square errors (%RMSE) of the measured transmission data and calculated transmission values were used to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated spectra. In addition, a hydroxylapatite (HA) phantom was used to study streak artifacts and evaluate the accuracy of the linear attenuation coefficients estimated using the IMPACT with SC. The %RMSE of the EM-with-SC estimated spectra were all lower than 1% and were also smaller than that without SC. The error in the quantification of the HA linear attenuation was only about 3% after SC. Our results showed that the quantitative accuracy of the linear attenuation coefficients measured with a cone beam CT was improved when the IMPACT with SC was used.
