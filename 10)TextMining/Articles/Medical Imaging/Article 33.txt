Axially Elongated Field-Free Point Data Acquisition in Magnetic Particle Imaging,

# The magnetic particle imaging (MPI) technology is a new imaging technique featuring an excellent possibility to detect iron oxide based nanoparticle accumulations in vivo. The excitation of the particles and in turn the signal generation in MPI are achieved by using oscillating magnetic fields. In order to realize a spatial encoding, a field-free point (FFP) is steered through the field of view (FOV). Such a positioning of the FFP can thereby be achieved by mechanical or electromagnetical movement. Conventionally, the data acquisition path is either a planar 2-D or a 3-D FFP trajectory. Assuming human applications, the size of the FOV sampled by such trajectories is strongly limited by heating of the body and by nerve stimulations. In this work, a new approach acquiring MPI data based on the axial elongation of a 2-D FFP trajectory is proposed. It is shown that such an elongation can be used as a data acquisition path to significantly increase the acquisition speed, with negligible loss of spatial resolution.
