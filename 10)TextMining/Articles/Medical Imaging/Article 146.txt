Spinal Navigation and Imaging: History, Trends, and Future,

# The clinical practice of spine navigation has rapidly grown with the development of image-based guidance. In this paper, a brief history of spinal navigation is presented and a review of clinical outcomes for pedicle screws placed using the latest technology in the sacral, lumbar and thoracic regions. The clinical evidence demonstrate that intraoperative 3D image guided surgery has a 96.8% success rate. A concluding section detailing existing barriers that limit more widespread adoption and future development efforts is presented.
