Statistical Interspace Models (SIMs): Application to Robust 3D Spine Segmentation,

# Statistical shape models (SSM) are used to introduce shape priors in the segmentation of medical images. However, such models require large training datasets in the case of multi-object structures, since it is required to obtain not only the individual shape variations but also the relative position and orientation among objects. A solution to overcome this limitation is to model each individual shape independently. However, this approach does not take into account the relative position, orientations and shapes among the parts of an articulated object, which may result in unrealistic geometries, such as with object overlaps. In this article, we propose a new Statistical Model, the Statistical Interspace Model (SIM), which provides information about the interaction of all the individual structures by modeling the interspace between them. The SIM is described using relative position vectors between pair of points that belong to different objects that are facing each other. These vectors are divided into their magnitude and direction, each of these groups modeled as independent manifolds. The SIM was included in a segmentation framework that contains an SSM per individual object. This framework was tested using three distinct types of datasets of CT images of the spine. Results show that the SIM completely eliminated the inter-process overlap while improving the segmentation accuracy.
