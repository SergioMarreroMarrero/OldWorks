Iterative Shrinkage Algorithm for Patch-Smoothness Regularized Medical Image Recovery,

# We introduce a fast iterative shrinkage algorithm for patch-smoothness regularization of inverse problems in medical imaging. This approach is enabled by the reformulation of current non-local regularization schemes as an alternating algorithm to minimize a global criterion. The proposed algorithm alternates between evaluating the denoised inter-patch differences by shrinkage and computing an image that is consistent with the denoised inter-patch differences and measured data. We derive analytical shrinkage rules for several penalties that are relevant in non-local regularization. The redundancy in patch comparisons used to evaluate the shrinkage steps are exploited using convolution operations. The resulting algorithm is observed to be considerably faster than current alternating non-local algorithms. The proposed scheme is applicable to a large class of inverse problems including deblurring, denoising, and Fourier inversion. The comparisons of the proposed scheme with state-of-the-art regularization schemes in the context of recovering images from undersampled Fourier measurements demonstrate a considerable reduction in alias artifacts and preservation of edges.
